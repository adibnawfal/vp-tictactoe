## Before Run the Game ðŸ”¥

1. Import `tictactoe.sql` to MySQL
2. Create **MySQL User Accounts** with the following details:

| Type      | Details           |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| Username  | visualprogramming |
| Password  | vp12345           |
| Host name | localhost         |

## Folder Structure ðŸ“‚

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management âš¡

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
